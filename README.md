# cloudflare-pages-template

Get started with [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) by deploying this pretty template on your own account, and start playing around.

## Step 1

Clone this Repository to your own GitHub account. 

Or download this Repository as a ZIP file by clicking the green button that says "<> Code" and clicking "Download ZIP", then extract the contents to a new folder, and upload the content (and only the content; not the folder) of that folder to a new GitHub Repository.

## Step 2

Access your _free_ Cloudflare account ([new to Cloudflare?](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/)), and go to the Pages tab.

## Step 5

If you want, you can update some content, including the [index.html](index.html).

You might want to update the following files with your own parameters:
- [robots.txt](robots.txt)
- [sitemap.xml](sitemap.xml)

## Step 6

Just hit "Save and Deploy" and let the magic happen! âœ¨

## Step 8 (Metadata)

Added `Functions/_middleware.js` from the GitHub Repo [Dynamic Social Previews Meta Tags with Cloudflare Pages](https://github.com/pew/cloudflare-pages-social-preview), in order to add Meta Tags.

Don't forget to edit the file [_middleware.js](functions/_middleware.js) with your own title, description, and such.
